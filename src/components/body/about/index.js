          <p>I am a Full Stack Developer. With a bachelor's degree in Management and Purchasing/Sales background, a great team player and leader with an excellent customer-oriented mindset. I also did some of my first steps in IT with an Uncompleted System Analyst in IES Siglo XXI, but now I can say it came full circle with Henry's Bootcamp, hence my logo next to my initials.</p>
