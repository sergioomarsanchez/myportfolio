          <p>I did some of my first steps in IT with an Uncompleted System Analyst in IES Siglo XXI, but now I can say it came full circle with Henry's Bootcamp, hence, my logo next to my initials. I also have a bachelor's degree in Management and Purchasing/Sales background, I am a great team player and leader with an excellent customer-oriented mindset. </p>
