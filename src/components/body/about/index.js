          <p>I am a Full Stack Developer in search of my first work experience as such, but this does not mean I have no experience. With a bachelor's degree in Management and Purchasing/Sales background, you will be hiring a great team player and leader with an excellent customer-oriented mindset. I also did some of my first steps in IT with an Uncompleted System Analyst in IES Siglo XXI now I can say it came full circle with Henry's Bootcamp.</p>
